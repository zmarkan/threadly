        <p>A library of java tools to assist with concurrent development.  There are tools to help with a wide range of development and testing.  This is designed to be a complement to java.util.concurrent and uses java.util.concurrent to help assist in it's implementations where it makes sense.   This library is particularly useful for getting legacy concurrent code and getting it under test.</p>

	<p>Included tools are designed to help with making performant and parallel code while keeping it safe and under test.  To get a more complete overview of our features take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/jentfoo/threadly/wiki/Threadly-Features">features wiki page</a>.</p>

	<p><h3>News:</h3>
	<p>* May 14th 2013 - Released the first initial release of Threadly.  This code has been a work in progress for a long time, I am very happy to finally have a version of it which is stable enough for this project to begin.</p>
