        <p>A library of java tools to assist with development of concurrent java applications. 
        This is designed to be a complement to java.util.concurrent and uses java.util.concurrent to help 
        assist in it's implementations where it makes sense.</p>

        <p>These tools range from a unique priority based, and highly performant thread pool.  To the ability to create a 
        hierarchy of thready pools (sub pools in threadly named "Limiters").  To the ability to control threading and allow 
        things to easily run single threaded where it makes sense.  This library also includes some utilities to assist in 
        debugging and bringing concurrent designs under test.</p>

  <p>To get a more complete overview of our features take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Threadly-Features">features wiki page</a>.</p>

  <p><h3>News:</h3>
  <p>* July 21st - Released version 2.3.0.  It's obviously only been about 2 weeks since the last release.  I know we frequently have been on a one month cadence, but that was really just by chance.  In general I just want to release once the build is ready and stable.  If we can keep the releases small, low risk, and semi-frequent, that's even better.  This release has a few very small defect fixes (arguments in constructors accidentally being ignored in PrioritySchedulerStatisticTracker and TaskSchedulerDistributor).  As well as a single deprecation to fix the spelling error in renaming ThrowableSurpressingRunnable to the correctly spelled ThrowableSuppressingRunnable.  The most major change is the build system.  The gradle wrapper is now included so that gradle does not need to be separately installed, and we have updated the build scripts to gradle 2.0.  All in all, steady progression in the project.</p>
  <p>* July 8th - Released version 2.2.0.  In this version we made improvements to our utilities for dealing with event driven, callback/listener based designs.  We ended up moving/renaming ListenerHelper to the new "event" package (the old one will still exist till 3.0.0).  Since we were already deprecating stuff for the event driven improvements, we decided to go ahead and rename the PriorityScheduledExecutor into the shorter named PriorityScheduler.  Again, it will continue to exist under the old name until the 3.0.0 release.  As always, please check the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Changelog">changelog</a> for a complete and detailed list for changes/improvements.</p>
  <p>* June 9th - Released version 2.1.0, this follows the patch release of 2.0.1.  We released version 2.0.1 to fix a bug found in NoThreadScheduler and SingleThreadScheduler where recurring tasks may be executed ahead of .execute or .submit tasks submitted while the task was running.  2.1.0 is mostly more bug fixes.  It does include some new features, most prominently is the improved shutdown logic around SingleThreadScheduler, which now has the ability to "shutdownNow".  In addition we improved some platform specific string formatting for the "Profiler", "DebugLogger" and "ExceptionUtils".  We want to continue to release frequently (once we know the code is stable and safe enough to do so), so I invite you to look at <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Changelog">changelog on the wiki</a> for more details.</p>
  <p>* May 27th - Major release of version 2.0.0 today!  This was not very long since our 1.3.0 release, but that is mostly because 2.0.0 had been in development in parallel for a couple months now.  This is a notable milestone for threadly.  We cleaned up our API quite a bit, and this includes some major advancements to maintainability for the code base going forward (particularly around unit tests).  There are not a ton of new features, but the biggest is the inclusion of the "SingleThreadScheduler".  Which is much lighter weight and faster than the PriortiyScheduledExecutor (but obviously can only work in a single threaded manner).  I recommend anyone checks the change log to see what api for the library has been removed, and how to update your projects (though you should already have an idea if your running 1.3.0 which has all removed API's marked as deprecated).</p>
  <p>* May 12th - Released version 1.3.0, which includes minor changes to the threadly project.  These are just a couple small changes that were easy to include in the 1.0.0 series of releases.  This will likely be the last 1.0.0 series of releases before 2.0.0, the only exception would be if any bugs are found.  There are no significant bug fixes or feature improvements in this release, as new features and improvements have been focused on the 2.0.0 release.</p>
  <p>* April 14th - Released version 1.2.0.  This includes some nice performance improvements around the TaskExecutorDistributor and the TaskSchedulerDistributor.  This also includes an expansion around our utilities around Future's/ListenableFuture's.  Otherwise this release is primarily doing some cleanup and starting to think about what we want to accomplish in our 2.0.0 release.  Some things have started migrating to some new api's.  We will probably start publishing a 2.0.0 artifact in the next couple of weeks.</p>
  <p>* March 19th - Released version 1.1.0, which includes a small expansion of the feature set.  This includes new tools like ListenableFutureResult, and ListenerHelper (which is a great tool for handling callbacks).  It also has some code and performance improvements around the thread pool limiters (aka sub pools).  Please look at the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Changelog">changelog on the wiki</a> for more details.</p>
  <p>* February 10th - Released version 1.0.0 of threadly.  This release is very exciting to me as it indicates a new level for the project.  A new level of stability and maturity, a new level of control and openness.  As in my previous post you will note that we removed and changed a lot more than we originally expected to.  I felt this was important because with the 1.0.0 release a lot of changes are occurring.  A stricter versioning is part of this, allowing people to easily know what level of risk and change is included in every version (as described <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Version-Guide">here on the wiki</a>).  We also plan to provide more visibility through pull requests, and filed issues into what exactly has changed (though the change log has always been very complete).  We had lots of things in the 0.9 release we decided to remove for 1.0.0 because we felt that they added a lot of complexity, and code, when their value was minimal at best.  Because it will be harder to remove those things in the future we decided now is the time to do it.  So they have been removed, but can be easily added back if others find any of those features useful (they were removed because no one was using them and we saw minimal reason someone would start using them).  Please look at the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Changelog">changelog on the wiki</a> for a more complete list of what has changed.</p>
  <p>* January 2nd - No new releases, but thought it was worth making a post about some changes occurring for the 1.0.0 release.  We decided we want to thin things down, and reduce some complexity before our 1.0.0 release.  Because of that we removed the following: VirtualLock, VirtualRunnable, VirtualCallable, TestablePriorityScheduler (which previously would take multi-threaded code and make it single threaded), FutureFuture, FutureListenableFuture, and combined SubmitterSchedulerLimiter and SimpleSchedulerLimiter into a single class "SchedulerLimiter".  I realize this is a bit more change than we wanted to do before our 1.0.0 release but after lots of consideration I think now is the right time.  This dramatically reduces the size and complexity.  In addition AFAIK no one was currently using any of these features (probably because they are not very useful).  The only exception that may have been the TestablePriorityScheduler which had the unique ability of taking multi-threaded code and making it single threaded.  This was a hard decision because that seems like a valuable feature for unit testing.  The reason we decided to remove it for now is because of the complexity it added.  Further more it required you to use our locking scheme so that we can handle blocking correctly between threads.  I don't particularly like the idea of having to change the run time code like this in order to support testability.  If anyone would like to see these features back (or any other new features), please submit a request via the Issues on github.  The great thing about git is that nothing is lost, and we can bring them back without too much headache if there is a demand.  But for now, we figured it is better to reduce our API to what we know is useful and being used, and only add as needed.  These changes have been pushed to sonatype under the version "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT".</p>
  <p>* December 24th - Released version 0.9 of threadly.  This version includes minor bug fixes (all with the profiler and statistics tracker), as well as improvements to the javadocs and formatting of the javadocs.  This is designed to be a hardening release before we release our first 1.0.0 version.  After which our versioning scheme will change (as described in our wiki).  So only changes included in this will be bug fixes (if any are found) and possible javadoc improvements....The only major change to the website is that I did remove the javadocs for versions 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4.  Those versions are now very old, and I would not recommend anyone use them (and AFAIK no one is).</p>
  <p>* October 31st - Released version 0.8...You may have noticed that our release frequency has slowed slightly.  That is because I am focusing on getting threadly as useable and stable as possible before the 1.0.0 release.  Check out the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Version-Guide">version guide on the wiki</a> for more details.  This release includes some bug fixes, some very minor functionality improvements, and as always more unit testing and better designed code.  The <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Changelog">changelog</a> has been updated with all the juicy details.</p>
  <p>* September 12th - Released version 0.7 of threadly.  This is the first release since 0.3 which has performance improvements.  Benchmarks show this to be the fastest threadly yet.  Speed improvements are primarily with the PriorityScheduledExecutor as well as use in Futures.  There are also some minor bug fixes included in this release, most of which were just not adhering to the interfaces set from java correctly.  Please see a change log for a complete list of fixes, improvements, and changes: <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Changelog">https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Changelog</a>.</p>
  <p>* August 9th 2013 - Released version 0.6 of threadly.  More stability improvements as well as additional features around Limiters and task distributors (which allows for execution to be single threaded based on a single key).  This release does include some package restructing which may not be backwards compatible.  The concurrent package was getting too large and needed to be separated out.</p>
  <p>* July 19th 2013 - Released version 0.5 of threadly.  This release includes some minor new features.  I decided to drop the schema of leap frogging the odd/even version numbers based on features.  This includes some nice new features I wanted to release, but nothing in this release is very risky.  Please check out the change log for more details: <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Changelog">https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Changelog</a>.</p>
  <p>* July 2nd 2013 - Released 0.4 to maven central.  This release was primarily bug fixes, but included some minor (but IMO important) feature improvements as well.  The most notable improvement is the use of sub-pools using the ExecutorLimiter and PrioritySchedulerLimiter.  These improvements are all very low risk, and have already been integrated into my works product.  For more details please look at the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Changelog">changelog on the wiki</a>.</p>
  <p>* May 30th 2013 - Released 0.3 to maven central.  This release dramatically increases the functionality.  Performance improvements for existing implementations, from new structure implementations (like ConcurrentArrayList which can be better than CopyOnWriteArrayList in some situations).  For a complete list of changes please look at the <a href="https://github.com/threadly/threadly/wiki/Changelog">changelog on the wiki</a>.</p>
