        <p>A library of java tools to assist with development of concurrent java applications. 
        It includes a collection of tools to help with a wide range of development and testing needs. 
        This is designed to be a complement to java.util.concurrent and uses java.util.concurrent to help 
        assist in it's implementations where it makes sense. This library is particularly useful for 
        getting legacy concurrent code and getting it under test.</p>

  <p>Included tools are designed to help with making performant and parallel code while keeping it 
  safe and under test.  To get a more complete overview of our features take a look at 
  our <a href="https://github.com/jentfoo/threadly/wiki/Threadly-Features">features wiki page</a>.</p>

  <p><h3>News:</h3>
  <p>* May 30th 2013 - Released 0.3 to maven central.  This release dramatically increases the functionality.  Performance improvements for existing implementations, from new structure implementations (like ConcurrentArrayList which can be better than CopyOnWriteArrayList in some situations).  For a complete list of changes please look at the <a href="https://github.com/jentfoo/threadly/wiki/Changelog">changelog on the wiki</a>.</p>
  <p>* May 20th 2013 - Released 0.2 to maven of Threadly.  I made one big mistake in the 0.1 artifact, which was I compiled with java 1.7 when I ment to release these artifacts with 1.6.  This was a big enough issue I decided to go ahead and release 0.2 sooner than I expected.  Luckily I have not found any bugs in 0.1 yet, so this release only includes some improvements to the unit tests, and compiled with java 1.6.</p>
  <p>* May 14th 2013 - Released the first initial release of Threadly.  This code has been a work in progress for a long time, I am very happy to finally have a version of it which is stable enough for this project to begin.</p>
