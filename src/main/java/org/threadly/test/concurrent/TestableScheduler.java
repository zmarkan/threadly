/**
 * <p>This differs from {@link org.threadly.concurrent.NoThreadScheduler} in that time is ONLY 
 * advanced via the tick calls.  That means that if you schedule a task, it will be scheduled 
 * off of either the creation time, or the last tick time, what ever the most recent point is.  
 * This allows you to progress time forward faster than it could in real time, having tasks 
 * execute faster, etc, etc.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The tasks in this scheduler are only progressed forward with calls to .tick().  
 * Since it is running on the calling thread, calls to .wait() and .sleep() from sub 
 * tasks will block (possibly forever).  The call to .tick() will not unblock till there 
 * is no more work for the scheduler to currently handle.</p>
