/**
 * <p>This class changes the behavior of how listeners are called from the parent class 
 * {@link ListenerHelper}.  In this implementation when listeners are invoked with the 
 * .call() function, the invocation of all the listeners will occur on the 
 * {@link Executor} that was provided at construction.  If the listener was added without 
 * a provided executor it will then run on the provided executor (in the thread doing the 
 * .call() invocation, AKA it will run that listener before executing other listeners).  
 * If the listener was added with a provided executor, that listener will still execute on 
 * the provided executor (so not necessarily the executor provided at construction time).<p>
 * 
 * <p>If it is desired that all listeners are executed asynchronously from each other, you 
 * should actually use the normal {@link ListenerHelper}, and instead just ensure that an 
 * executor is provided when each listener is added.  If you want listeners to execute 
 * concurrently from each other, but not concurrently for any single listener, 
 * {@link DefaultExecutorListenerHelper} is likely a better choice.  This class is only 
 * designed to ensure that .call() invocations will never block.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To better clarify when this implementation makes sense compared to 
 * {@link ListenerHelper} and {@link DefaultExecutorListenerHelper}.  If you have a LOT of 
 * quick running listeners, this is the right class for you.  If you have few listeners that 
 * execute quickly, then the normal {@link ListenerHelper} is likely a better choice.  If 
 * you have long running/complex listeners, {@link DefaultExecutorListenerHelper} is 
 * possibly the better choice.  Alternative for the last condition you could use the normal 
 * {@link ListenerHelper}, and just ensure that an executor is provided for every listener   
 * (but if you want to ensure a given listener is not executed concurrently the 
 * {@link DefaultExecutorListenerHelper} will handle this for you).</p>
 * 
 * <p>It is important to note that this class does not ensure ordering of how listeners are 
 * called.  For example if you provided a multi-threaded executor, and are calling the 
 * listeners twice, those listeners call order is non-deterministic.  If this is important to 
 * you, you must ensure that the Executor provided is single threaded (ie by using the 
 * {@link org.threadly.concurrent.TaskExecutorDistributor} to get an executor from a single 
 * key, or by using the {@link org.threadly.concurrent.limiter.ExecutorLimiter} with a limit 
 * of one, or an instance of the {@link org.threadly.concurrent.SingleThreadScheduler}).</p>
