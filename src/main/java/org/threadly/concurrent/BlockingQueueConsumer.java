/**
 * <p>Producer consumer problems are very frequent within multi-threaded code.  This class 
 * is designed to be a throttle for both sides of the problem.  It takes in a BlockingQueue 
 * so that items are only consumed as they become available.  At the same time it has a 
 * {@link ConsumerAcceptor} that will only accept items as it is ready.  By accepting on 
 * the same thread as the consumer it will only try to take more items after the 
 * acceptConsumedItem call returns.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Another way to look at it, this class provides the thread to handle blocking when consuming 
 * from a BlockingQueue.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Keep in mind that this class in no way attempts to solve the problem if the program is 
 * producing faster than the consumer accepts.  In those conditions the queue will still continue to 
 * grow, and consume memory.</p>
