 * This class can be very useful in GUI development (if you want it to run on the GUI

 * 
 * <p>The tasks in this scheduler are only progressed forward with calls to .tick().  
 * Since it is running on the calling thread, calls to .wait() and .sleep() from sub 
 * tasks will block (possibly forever).  The call to .tick() will not unblock till there 
 * is no more work for the scheduler to currently handle.</p>
