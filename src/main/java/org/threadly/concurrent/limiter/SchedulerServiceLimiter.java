/**
 * <p>This class is designed to limit how much parallel execution happens on a provided 
 * {@link SchedulerServiceInterface}.  This allows the implementor to have one thread pool 
 * for all their code, and if they want certain sections to have less levels of 
 * parallelism (possibly because those those sections would completely consume the global 
 * pool), they can wrap the executor in this class.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Thus providing you better control on the absolute thread count and how much 
 * parallelism can occur in different sections of the program.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is an alternative from having to create multiple thread pools.  By using this you 
 * also are able to accomplish more efficiently thread use than multiple thread pools would.</p>
 * 
 * 
 * <p>This extends the {@link SimpleSchedulerLimiter} to add {@link SchedulerServiceInterface} 
 * features.  This does not cause any performance hits, but does require a source 
 * {@link SchedulerServiceInterface} to rely on.  If you have a {@link SchedulerServiceInterface} 
 * available this implementation should be preferred over the {@link SimpleSchedulerLimiter}.</p>
