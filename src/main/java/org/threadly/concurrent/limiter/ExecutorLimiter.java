/**
 * <p>This class is designed to limit how much parallel execution happens 
 * on a provided {@link Executor}.  This allows the user to have one 
 * thread pool for all their code, and if they want certain sections 
 * to have less levels of parallelism (possibly because those those 
 * sections would completely consume the global pool), they can wrap 
 * the executor in this class.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Thus providing you better control on the absolute thread count and 
 * how much parallelism can occur in different sections of the program.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is an alternative from having to create multiple thread pools.  
 * By using this you also are able to accomplish more efficiently thread use 
 * than multiple thread pools would.</p>
